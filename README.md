## Data Source
The dataset in this project has been taken from Kaggle and stored into this Github repo in data folder. It is being used fetched by Data Factory pipeline later on.

Dataset- [Tokyo Olympics Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo)


## Steps followed while execution-
- Export dataset from Kaggle and Store in Github
- Ceate Azure Data Factory Pipeline for extracting data from Github and store in Azure Data Lake Gen2
- Connect Azure Databricks workspace to ADLS Gen2 and perform necessary transformations on raw data
- Write transformed data through Databricks into ADLS Gen2
- Create DB through Data lake in Azure Synapse analytics and run SQL queries on the data to analyze it.
- Visualize the data using PowerBI dashboard.
